            The acronym BMR stands for Basal Metabolic Rate.
            It is the number of calories your body burns during complete rest.
            Your body needs some energy even during siesta for performing some
            basic functions like breathing, circulating blood, and repairing cells.
            You can get an insight into your energy level if you know the BMR levels.
            <br>
            Your body burns more calories by movement and exercise.
            So, by monitoring your consumption, it will be better to prevent unwanted
            weight gains or severe weight loss.

        <h2>How it calculate Your BMR?</h2>

        BMR was introduced to the world by James Arthur Harris and Francis Gano Benedict. So, the equation is popularly
        known as the Harris-Benedict formula. A new equation was formulated in 1990, which is known as the Mifflin-St.
        George equation.

        <br>

        P= (10.0 x m/1 kg) + (6.25 x h/1cm) - (5.00 x a/1 year) + s

        <br>
        Here:
        <br>
        P= total energy output during rest(BMR)
        <br>
        M= weight of the person in kgs
        <br>
        H= height of the concerned person
        <br>
        A= age of the incumbent
        <br>
        S= constant which is +5 for males and -161 for females
